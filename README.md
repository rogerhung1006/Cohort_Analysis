# Cohort Analysis

## Introduction
Cohort Analysis is a powerful tool that enables businesses to analyze user behavior pattern and uncover actionable insights and thus customized their products and marketing strategy toward different user segments. I find the technique so useful and powerful, and one can learn the complete code on DataCamp. In this project, I performed a cohort analysis with Python on 20% of the UCI Online Retail Dataset

#### What is a cohort?
A cohort is a group of people who have a common characteristic during a period of time. For example, you can group the users based on demographics, first purchase month, or even acquisition channel.

#### Why is it valuable? 
The importance of cohort analysis cannot be overemphasized. Among all the fascinating things that this analysis can achieve, one thing I find most important is that cohort analysis can be helpful when it comes to understanding the loyalty of your customers. This is critical since it’s far cheaper and easier to keep a current customer than to acquire a new one. For startups, it’s also a key indicator of [product-market fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit).

## Results
### Example 1. Retention Rates
Both heatmap and line chart are good ways to spot behavioral differences in cohort analysis. I personally prefer to use the heatmap for behavior pattern analysis in specific cohort, and use the other for better comparison between cohorts.
